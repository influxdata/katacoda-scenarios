# Exploring Metrics

That's it! You can now browse to your [dashboard](https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-19999-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/) and login.

## Exploring Metrics

Go to the "Data Explorer" by clicking on the item on the left hand menu. Once there, you can select a measurement (try `cpu`) and then some fields (try `usage_system` and `usage_user`), and click "Submit".

You'll see this update the graph above.

If there's no `cpu` to be clicked, give it a few seconds and refresh; Telegraf may not have written its first batch of data yet.
